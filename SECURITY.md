# Security, Shmecurity!

At Gleamy, we take security seriously. Just kidding! We take security seriously seriously. We believe that security should be one of the top priorities for any software project, so we've created a security policy to help us keep our codebase as secure as possible.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you stumble upon any security vulnerabilities in our code, please let us know ASAP! We promise not to make fun of you for being a hacker. Instead, we'll shower you with praise and gratitude for helping us keep our users' data safe.

To report a security issue, go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gleamy-js/gleamy/issues) and post the issue here. We'll get back to you as soon as possible and keep you updated on our progress.

## Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We take a responsible approach to vulnerability disclosure, and we're committed to working with security researchers to patch any vulnerabilities in our code. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Create an issue at our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gleamy-js/gleamy/issues) with details of the vulnerability.
2. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to respond to your report before making any information public.
3. Once we've responded to your report, we'll work with you to ensure that any vulnerabilities are fixed and properly disclosed to the public.

## Security Bug Bounty Program

Listen up, folks! We know that you're working hard and putting your heart and soul into making Gleamy awesome. And we want to reward you for your efforts, we really do. But unfortunately, we can't offer any monetary compensation at the moment. Why, you ask? Well, because Gleamy doesn't have any funding yet! That's right, we're still operating on a shoestring budget and a whole lot of love. But don't worry, we're working hard to change that. In the meantime, we hope you'll stick with us and keep contributing your amazing talents to make Gleamy the best it can be. Who knows, maybe one day we'll be rolling in dough and able to offer you all the glitter cones and gold-dipped potatoes your heart desires!

Happy hacking!
