# Gleamy Code of Conduct

Welcome to Gleamy, a project that celebrates the beauty of shine and glimmer on the web! We're excited to have you on board. Please take a moment to read and understand our code of conduct.

## Our Pledge

In the pursuit of shiny, sparkly, and dazzling web experiences, we aim to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. We value and respect the diverse perspectives and experiences of all contributors, including those whose brains work a little differently, such as neurodivergent.

## Our Standards

To help us create a safe and fun space for everyone, we ask that all contributors to Gleamy follow these standards:

- Be respectful and kind to others
- Refrain from using derogatory language or engaging in any form of discrimination or harassment
- Be open to feedback and constructive criticism
- Keep in mind that people with ADHD, ASD or any neurodivergent minds can have a different perception and understanding than you may do. So be patient and understanding in communication and problem-solving
- Dipping things in gold is awesome, but let's keep the metaphorical gold-dipping to our code, not our interactions with others

## Our Responsibilities

As maintainers of this project, we are responsible for enforcing this code of conduct. If you notice any violations, please report them to us by emailing **yet_to_be@created**. We will review all reports promptly and take appropriate action.
Our Pledge to You

As a contributor to Gleamy, you have our pledge that we will uphold these standards and ensure that everyone feels safe, valued, and welcome. We will also work to improve the project and foster a community that is diverse, inclusive, and fun.

We hope this code of conduct makes everyone feel welcome and valued in our shiny, gleamy world of web design.
